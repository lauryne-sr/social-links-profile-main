# Social Links Profile

This project is a solution to the **Social Links Profile** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The goal was to build a responsive profile card that includes a profile picture, name, location, a short bio, and a list of social links — all styled to match the provided design as closely as possible.
